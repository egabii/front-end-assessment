## React Coding Challenge: Memory Card GameOverview

In this challenge, you will create a simple Memory Card Game using React. The game will involve flipping cards to find matching pairs. This project should take a few hours to complete and will test your skills in working with React components, state management, event handling, and CSS styling.

### Requirements

- Setup the Project

  - Fork the following repo to your personal github account as a starting point: https://github.com/Marageti/front-end-assessment
  - Initialize the project.
